# Flappy Bird

This is a Flappy Bird clone made with Python. The intention is to implement an AI that will play the game.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands to setup your virtual environment, activate it, and install packages:

```
python3 -m venv venv/
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install <package-name>
```

Start the game by running the following command from the root directory:
```
python3 src/game/main.py
```

Deactivate the virtual environment when done by simply running `deactivate`
